# JRCHackathon - Brick Breaker

## Concept 

<br>

<p>For our Hackathon submission we are going for a remake of the old Atari Classic Breakout.
We will be adding extra content throughout the project if time constraints allow.</p> 
<p>This will be outlined in the ReadME.</p>



## How to Play

<br>

<p> Deployment page : (https://marshalljd1.github.io/JRCHackathon/)
<p> Use the mouse on Desktops to control the paddle </p>
<p> --Touch device controls to be implimented--</p>
<p> Press the start button to set the game in motion and keep that rally up!</p>
<p>Destroy all the bricks and dont miss your rebounds</p>

## Project Planning 

<br>
<p>
 We have mostly been using (https:www.miro.com), the project board in Github and slack for huddles and communications.
</p>
<p>
  Prior to starting the development in our IDE's; we went to balsamiq and created a few wireframes for our idea.
  We wanted to hit all the Learning objectives given to us, one of them being 'responsive design between all devices'.
  So we have planned our designs for Tablet/Mobile and desktop.
</p>

## Wire frames

<br>

<p>These are loose plans for out UI and maywell differ throughou the project</p>

<p> Below is the Wire frame for mobile devices</p>

## Project Board

<br>

<p> We have used Co-pilot to help us with creating some user stories for our development.
This way we can acurately set out what we need for an mvp and the entire team can track the 
progress of our implementation </p>
